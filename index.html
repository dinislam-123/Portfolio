      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Islam.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="placeholder">
      <p>I am full Stack web developer and computer programmer and have more than 5 years programming experience on server and client server environment. I finished 2 years Advanced Diploma in Computer Studies from Singapore after I finished grade 12.</p>
      <p>Based on environment, I changed development tools but I didn't change programming logic to develop and debug the program. 
      After development I spent more times for testing, documentation and implementation.
      When I faced problem to debug the programming bug, I do unit then integration testing process. User acceptance testing also very importent.</p>
      <p>I have experience with SDLC and Agile methodology from mockup to rollout</p>
      <p>Recently I have finished UftBootCamp Full Stack web development course from University of Toronto and learned new technologies JavaScript, jQuery, node.js, Express, Firebase, mysql, Mongodb and react.js. This course provided me to work with confidence and individually.</p>
      <p>I am confident to develop full stack dynamic, cross platform, browser compatibility online applications. I am always try to develop myself through learning new technology if I get chance.</p>
      <p>Some soft skills I support like: Teamwork, Accountability, Time Management, Adaptability, Work Ethic and etc.</p>
