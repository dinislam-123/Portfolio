      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Islam.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="placeholder">
      <p>I am Full Stack developer and computer programmer and have more than 5+ years programming experience on server and client server applications. I finished 2 years Advanced Diploma in Computer Studies from Singapore after I finished grade 12.</p>
      <p>Based on environment, I changed development tools but I didn't change programming logic to develop and debug the program
      After development I spent more times for testing and documentations
      When I faced problem to fix the programming bug, I tested code block by block or small part by part</p>
      <p>Recently I have finished UftBootCamp Full Stack web development course from University of Toronto and learned new technologies JavaScript, jQuery, node.js, Express, Firebase, mysql, Mongodb and react.js. This course provided me to work with confidence and individually.</p>
